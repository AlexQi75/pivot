  <p><b>Carl Bernstein</b>, speaking here today at the Perugia Journalism Festival, was on top form. He admitted during his interview, which included questions from a packed audience, that he gave long-winded answers, and that was probably true, but he had a lot to say that showed that the Watergate hero certainly has a fine grasp of the problems facing modern journalism.</p> 

  <p>He ranged over many topics during the 90 minutes he was on stage at the delightful Teatro del Pavone, touching several times on Watergate - of course - and plugging his latest book, a biography of Hillary Clinton. But I want to concentrate on what he said about the state of journalism.</p>

  <p>He is clear-sighted enough not to fall into the trap of proclaiming that the 1970s, or any era, represented a golden age of journalism. <mark>Instead, he pointed to the changed media environment in the States, the changing culture and the economic stresses that underlie what gets published, what doesn't and the difficulties faced by reporters.</mark><sup>[1245 notes]</sup></p>

  <p>He talked of consolidation by the conglomerates that "makes truth-seeking secondary to making huge profits". And, given that making any profit all has become increasingly difficult, the task of carrying out good journalism is more difficult than ever before.</p>

  <p>Good journalism, he explained, is "a simple matter but difficult to achieve", namely "trying to obtain the best attainable version of the truth." And the best way of doing that? "Being a good listener." And? "Listening to source after source after source". And? Knocking on doors and wearing out shoe leather.</p>

  <p>And? Not setting out with a preconceived notion of what the story might be. "Our function", he said, "is not to create a desired political result. It is to illuminate." However, he conceded that "journalists decide what is news, which is the most subjective of judgments and makes a nonsense of the idea of our work being objective."</p>

  <p>Bernstein believes that the web is redefining "what is news" and "is taking us back towards what news ought to be." He agreed that there was also "unchecked crap" in the blogosphere but, overall, his view of the possibilities of online journalism seemed very positive. He liked the "free-for-all, opinionated, noisy, different stuff" that is available on the web.</p>

  <p>At the same time, reviving a theme he first mooted in a 1992 essay (from which I quote in my lectures to my students), <mark>he talked of his concern about the "triumph of the idiot culture" that is represented by so much media content. He attacked the "grotesque amount of weird, stupid and coarse" content along with the "manufactured controversy" that masquerades as news, arguing as an aside that local TV news in the States does not reflect reality.</mark><sup>[798 notes]</sup></p> 

  <p>He talked a little about the coverage of the Iraq war, contending that post-war coverage by several US papers - including the New York Times, Washington Post and New Yorker - has been particularly good in revealing the secrets of President Bush's administration. He was much more circumspect about the pre-war coverage, admitting that the NYTimes had not covered itself with glory in its coverage.</p>

  <p>However, he rejected the idea that reporters should, or could, have known about the existence of weapons of mass destruction. His message: we were all fooled (including Tony Blair and Alastair Campbell).</p>

  <p>Bernstein also spoke about his parents' politics (they were members of the American Communist Party) and its possible effect on him. He said that he thought it might have made him distrust government agencies and might also have made him an iconoclast.</p>

  <p>But its most positive effect, he implied, was that the secrets his parents kept from him as a child (in order to protect him) may well have piqued his later curiosity and desire to expose secrets. It made me ask, he said, "what is our reality?"</p>

  <p>Overall, a hugely interesting interview with a man who did his level best to play down his own journalistic celebrity. It rightly concluded with lengthy applause.</p>
